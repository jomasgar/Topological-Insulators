# Topological-Insulators
Python codes aimed at solving topological insulator tight-binding models

This codes are graduate level python codes used in my final degree project, for the resolution of tight-binding Hamiltonians describing topological
insulators, and the determination of their topological properties.

The DOS file, is a possible implemetation to the ribbon class in the QWZ model for density of states calculations
